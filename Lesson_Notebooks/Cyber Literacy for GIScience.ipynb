So far we have learned that cyberinfrastructure provides the technological connection for communities, it is quite literally the glue between technology and science communities. So how do we use it? To become **_cyberinfrastructure users_** requires new knowledge and skills. We call this **_cyber literacy_** and we will focus on the community that tries to capture the world around us in a computer or **_geographic information science_** the 17+ lessons in the Hour of CI will develop **_cyber literacy for GIScience_**, which is applicable to a wide variety of science communities from social to environmental sciences."
