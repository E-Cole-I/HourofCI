FADE IN on a composite glass shot over the Hoboken docks -
New York Skyline dimly seen in background. Snow. Sounds of
tugboat whistles. DISSOLVE TO -

Ship's side gangway slopes up out of picture.

Weston, a theatrical agent, comes along wharf, peering at
ship. He is fifty, heavy, slow, but with a shrewd eye. He
turns up his collar and shivers, stops and looks at ship
doubtfully.

An old watchman comes along wharf from opposite side,
swinging a lantern.

swinging a lantern.

     WESTON
          Hey, Is this the moving picture ship?

     WATCHMAN
          The Venture? Yep.
              (Weston starts for gangway)
          You going on this crazy voyage?

     WESTON
              (pausing)
          What's crazy about it?

     WATCHMAN
          I dunno know, but I hear everybody
          talkin' about this crazy feller
          that's running it.

     WESTON
          Carl Denham?

     WATCHMAN
          Guess that's the name. They say he
          ain't scare of nothin' - if he
          wants a picture of a lion he walks
          right up and tells it to look
          pleasant.

     WESTON
          He's a tough egg, all right. But
          why the talk about this voyage
          being crazy?

     WATCHMAN
          Wal, there's talk around the docks
          about the cargo for one thing. And
          I never see a ship this size with
          such a crew.

     WESTON
          Not enough men to handle her?

     WATCHMAN
          Not enough! The crew's three times
          too big for the ship. I dunno know
          where they find enough room to
          sleep.

     DRISCOLL
              (from above deck)
          Hey, there! What do you want?

     WESTON
          Denham aboard?

     DRISCOLL
              (comes down gangway into picture)
          Yes. Who are you?

     WESTON
          I want to see him. I'm Weston, the agent.

     DRISCOLL
          Come aboard. Denham's getting wild.
          Hope you have some good news for him.



INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Denham and Englehorn talking.

     ENGLEHORN
          Well, Mr. Denham, you know the
          reasons for hurrying as well as I
          do. The insurance company has found
          out we're carrying explosives, and
          the Marshal will be aboard tomorrow
          or next day.

     DENHAM
          I suppose if we make a legal case
          of it, we'll be tied up for months.

     ENGLEHORN
          With ship's articles falsified and
          ammunition enough aboard to blow up
          the harbor?
              (he takes a bomb from case
on floor)
          And what do you think the Marshall
          will say to these new gas-bombs?
          According to you one of them is
          powerful enough to knock out an
          elephant.

     DENHAM
              (pacing up and down)
          We've got to get to where we're
          going before the monsoon starts.

     ENGLEHORN
          You can trust me to get you through
          a blow, I hope.

     DENHAM
          Don't get sore, Skipper. But you
          know what it means to hit the
          tropical rainy season when we're
          making an outdoor picture. Months
          wasted, money gone, and nothing to
          show for it.

     ENGLEHORN
          But still you always bring back a
          picture and everyone says, "There
          is only one Carl Denham."

Driscoll and Weston come in.

     DENHAM
          Weston! I was just going ashore to
          ring you up.

     WESTON
          If I'd known that, I'd have waited.

     DENHAM
          Meet the Skipper.
              (to Englehorn)
          This is Weston, the theatrical
          agent.
              (they shake hands)
          And this is Driscoll, the first
          mate. Well, where's the girl,
          Weston?

     WESTON
          It can't be done, Denham.

     DENHAM
          What? It's got to done.
              (Weston shakes his head in
silence)
          Look here, Weston. The Actor's
          Equity and the Hays outfit have
          interfered with every girl I've
          tried to hire; now every agent in
          town has shut down on me. All but
          you. You know I'm square -

     WESTON
          Everybody knows you're square,
          Denham but you've got a reputation
          for recklessness that can't be
          glossed over. And then you're so
          secretive.

     DRISCOLL
          I'll say so.

     ENGLEHORN
          When even the skipper and the mate
          don't know where they're going --
              (he shrugs)

     WESTON
          There you are. I've got a
          conscience, Denham. I can't send a
          young, pretty girl, such as you
          want, on a job like this without
          telling her what to expect.

     DENHAM
          And what is she to expect?

     WESTON
          To go off for no one knows how
          long, to some place you won't even
          hint at, the only woman on a ship
          with the toughest mugs I ever
          looked at.
              (they all laugh)
          I mean the crew.

     DENHAM
          Good Lord, you'd think I never
          brought anybody back alive! The
          Skipper and Driscoll have stuck by
          me on two trips. They seem healthy.

     DRISCOLL
          Sure we're healthy.

     ENGLEHORN
          But it's different taking a girl
          into danger.

     DENHAM
          Oh, I suppose there's no danger in
          New York? Why, there are dozens of
          girls in this town tonight in more
          danger than they'd ever see with
          me.

     DRISCOLL
              (drily)
          Sure. But they know that kind of
          danger.

     WESTON
          You never had a woman in your other
          pictures, why do you want one in
          this?

     DENHAM
              (exploding)
          Holy mackerel D'ye think I want to
          haul a woman along?

     WESTON
          Then why - ?

     DENHAM
          Because the public - bless 'em -
          must have a pretty face to look at.

     WESTON
          Everybody likes romance.

     DENHAM
          Isn't there any romance or
          adventure in the world without a
          flapper in it?

     ENGLEHORN
          Well, Mr. Denham, why not make a
          picture in a monastery?
              (they all laugh)

     DENHAM
          It makes me sore. I go out and
          sweat blood to make a swell
          picture, and then the exhibitors
          and critics all say, "if this
          picture had a love interest, it
          would gross twice as much." All
          right, the public wants a girl, and
          this time I'll give 'em what they
          want.

     WESTON
              (rising)
          I don't know where you'll get her.

     DENHAM
          Weston, I've got to. We've got to
          sail on the morning tide - we've
          got to be out of here by daylight -

     WESTON
          Why?

     DENHAM
          Well - there's a good reason.

     WESTON
          Everything I hear makes me like
          this thing less. I'm glad I didn't
          get you a girl.

     DENHAM
          You are, eh? Well, I'll show you.
          If you think I'm going to give up
          just because you can't find a girl
          with a backbone --
              (he is struggling into his
overcoat)
          -- I'm going to make the greatest
          picture in the world, something
          that's never been seen or dreamed
          of. They'll have to invent some new
          adjectives when I come back.
              (he is at the door)

     ENGLEHORN
          Where are you going?

     DENHAM
          I'm going to bring back a girl for
          my picture -- if I have to marry
          one!

DISSOLVE TO Long Shot - Broadway at night - stock

CUT TO Denham walking along, scanning faces as he walks.

DISSOLVES of faces of women, Broadway types, bold,
indifferent, heavy, ugly - most of them heavily painted.
Rapidly passing, as though the camera were Denham looking
them over.

CUT TO Denham. He shakes his head disgustedly, stops, wheels
around and starts in another direction, as though he's given
up that part of town, and thought of another possibility.

DISSOLVE TO Exterior of a Woman's Mission. A bread-line
waiting. Camera moves slowly down the line of faces as
thought Denham were looking them over.

CUT TO Denham. He shrugs his shoulders in despair, turns
away.

DISSOLVE TO Exterior of one of those Small Wooden Stands you
see in the West Forties, a fruit-tobacco and candy shop just
big enough for the proprietor and one customer to get into,
a stand of fruit and peanut-roaster on sidewalk.
Denham comes along, takes out cigarette case, it's empty,
he goes in to buy some. We see through window that he
is taking cigarettes and paying the Greek proprietor.

Ann Darrow comes slowly into picture; she hesitates, her
hand goes stealthily toward a piece of fruit.

She is fingering it when the Greek dashes out and seizes
her. She tries to pull her arm away. Denham comes out of
shop.

     GREEK
              (very excited)
          Ah-ha! I catch you, you stealer! I
          catch the cop - you like that, ha!

     ANN
              (she keeps her head bent,
struggling weakly to pull
away)
          No-no, I didn't.  Please let me go.
          I wanted to, but I didn't.

     GREEK
          I had enough dese stealers --

     DENHAM
          Oh, dry up. The kid didn't take
          anything.

     ANN
          I didn't, truly I didn't.

     DENHAM
          So, shut up, Socrates. Here's a
          dollar. Forget it.

The Greek takes the money and releases Ann who stumbles back
against Denham. He catches her round the shoulders and she
half-collapses. Her head falls back on his arm. He has his
first sight of her face.

CLOSE UP Ann, her eyes open as she looks up at Denham,
terrified.

MEDIUM SHOT - Denham, holding Ann. He looks at her. Suddenly
his face lights up, he snaps his fingers triumphantly.

     DENHAM
              (looking up the street)
          Hi! Taxi!

DISSOLVE TO a one-armed lunch room. Tiled wall, two chairs.
Ann has emptied plate and coffee mug on arm of her chair.
Denham in other chair watching her. She sighs happily over
having satisfied her hunger, and leans back.

     DENHAM
          Feeling better?

     ANN
          Yes, thank you. You're very kind.

     DENHAM
          Don't fool yourself. I'm not
          bothering with you just out of
          kindness.
              (Ann opens her eyes wide,
half-puzzled, half
afraid)
          How come you're in this fix?

     ANN
          Bad luck I guess. There are lots of
          girls just like me.

     DENHAM
          There aren't such a lot who've got
          your looks.

     ANN
              (laughing it off)
          Oh, I can get by in good clothes.
          But when a girl gets too shabby --

     DENHAM
          No family?

     ANN
          I'm supposed to have an uncle
          somewhere.

     DENHAM
          Ever do any acting?

     ANN
          I used to do some extra jobs over
          at Fort Lee sometimes. Once I got a
          real part. The studio is shut down
          now.

     DENHAM
          What's you name?

     ANN
          Ann Darrow.

     DENHAM
          Are you one of these city gals who
          screams at a mouse and faints at a
          snake?

     ANN
              (laughing)
          No, of course not. I'm a country
          gal - or used to be.

     DENHAM
          Listen, sister. I've got a job for
          you. The costumes I've got on board
          will fit you.
              (looks at his watch)
          The Broadway shops will still be
          open. I'll get you some clothes for
          yourself. Come on.

     ANN
          But - but what is it?

     DENHAM
              (excited)
          It's money, and adventure, and
          fame.
          It's the thrill of a lifetime. And
          a long sea-voyage that starts at
          six tomorrow morning.

     ANN
          No! Wait, I can't - I don't
          understand - you must tell me - I
          do want the job so - I was starving
          - but I can't -

Denham has been looking at her, puzzled because she hasn't
caught his frantic excitement. He suddenly sees what is
troubling her. He calms down and goes back and sits.

     DENHAM
          Oh, I see. You got me wrong. Nix,
          sister, nix. This is strictly
          business. I'm no chaser.

     ANN
              (meekly)
          I only wanted to -

     DENHAM
          Sure. Sure you did. I dot excited
          and forgot you didn't understand
          it. Listen, I'm Carl Denham. Ever
          hear of me?

     ANN
          Ye-es. Yes. You make moving
          pictures. In jungles and places.

     DENHAM
          That's right. And I've picked you
          for the lead in my next picture. We
          sail at six.

     ANN
          Where to?

     DENHAM
          A long way from here. Think, Ann, a
          long voyage, easy living, the warm
          blue sea, moonlight on the water -
          isn't that better than tramping New
          York trying to keep out of the
          gutter.

     ANN
              (almost whispers)
          Oh, yes.

     DENHAM
          I'm square, Ann. And I'll be square
          with you. No funny business.

     ANN
          What do I have to go?

     DENHAM
              (leaning over her chair
and looking straight at
her)
          Trust me. And keep your chin up.

Ann looks at him for a moment, then he holds out his hand.

She takes it and they shake. FADE OUT.

FADE IN - deck of ship at dawn, getting under way. Crew busy
casting off lines, moving stuff on deck. A tug is puffing
alongside. Driscoll on fo'c'sle head directing.

MEDIUM SHOT - Ann in same dress, but wearing a heavy loose
coat Denham has bought her. She climbs to fo'c'sle head,
watching this strange new world.

Driscoll backs into scene without seeing her. He is shouting
at a sailor.

     DRISCOLL
          Carry that line aft! Aft, you
          farmer! Back there!

He swings his arm round behind him in a violent full-armed
gesture and hits Ann in the face. She staggers back against
the rail and nearly falls.

     DRISCOLL
              (turning)
          Who the -- What are you going up
          here?

     ANN
              (meekly, hand to her face)
          I just wanted to see!

     DRISCOLL
              (gruffly)
          Well, I'm sorry. You're the girl
          Denham found at the last minute,
          aren't you?

     ANN
          Yes. I'm - I'm awfully excited.
          It's all so strange, and I've never
          been on a ship before.

     DRISCOLL
          And I've never been on a ship with
          a woman before.

     ANN
          I guess you don't think much of
          women on ships, do you?

     DRISCOLL
          No. They're a cock-eyed nuisance.

     ANN
          I'll try not to be.

     DRISCOLL
          You got in the way already. Better
          stay below.

     ANN
          What! The whole voyage!
              (she smiles at him)

     DRISCOLL
              (hesitates, then says in a
softened tone -)
          Say, I didn't apologize very good
          for hitting you. That was an awful
          sock in the jaw.

Driscoll stares at her doubtfully, she looks up and meets
his gaze. Their eyes hold for a moment, then two short toots
from a tug alongside, answered by one blast from the ship.

     DRISCOLL
          Well, we're off.

     ANN
              (clasping her hands and
peering into the mist)
          We're off.

DISSOLVE TO - Long shot - Miniature ship at sea - DAY

DISSOLVE TO - The deck of the ship at sea. A calm tropical
afternoon. Ann and Charley, the Chinese cook, at rail.
Charley with enormous tub of potatoes, peeling them. Ann
making an intricate knot with a bit of rope's end, fooling
with it as she talks.

     ANN
          Charley, how many potatoes do you
          suppose you've peeled since we left
          New York six weeks ago?

     CHARLEY
          Too many.

     ANN
          Sailors eat an awful lot, don't
          they?

     CHARLEY
          All time eat. No can fill up. Some
          day my go back to China, never see
          no more potato.

Ann finishes the knot and tugs at it.

     ANN
          There. That's fourteen knots I've
          learned to tie.

     CHARLEY
          Pretty soon now you be same sailor.
          Only don't eat so much.

     ANN
              (laughs, then looks around
with a contented sigh)
          I'd like to be a sailor. Isn't the
          sea wonderful!

     CHARLEY
              (drily)
          Oh yes, very pretty.

     ANN
          Of course it wasn't so nice up
          north when it was cold and rough.

     CHARLEY
          Ocean very fine when you order
          weather how you like all same like
          eggs for breakfast.

Driscoll strolls in. Charley gets up and moves away.

     DRISCOLL
          Hello, Ann.

     ANN
          Hello, Jack.

     DRISCOLL
          Where have you been all morning?

     ANN
          Trying on costumes for Mr. Denham.
          He's going to make some tests of me
          this afternoon, here on deck, when
          the light's right.

     DRISCOLL
          Tests? Why?

     ANN
          Oh - to see which side of my face
          looks best - and all that.

     DRISCOLL
              (very gruff)
          Both sides looks all right to me.

     ANN
              (laughs)
          Yes, but you're not the movie
          director.

     DRISCOLL
          If I was, you wouldn't be here.

     ANN
          Well, that's a nice thing to say.

     DRISCOLL
          It's no place for a girl.

     ANN
              (indignantly)
          I wish you wouldn't keep harping on
          that. It's very mean of you.
          Anybody'd think I'd been a lot of
          trouble.

Driscoll grunts.

     ANN
              (very cross)
          I haven't! You can't say I've been
          one bit of trouble to anyone.

Driscoll is silent.

     ANN
              (looks at him, waits, then
anxiously)
          Have I?

     DRISCOLL
          Sure you have.

     ANN
          I don't see - Well, how?

     DRISCOLL
          Just your being here's a trouble.

     ANN
              (mournfully)
          Oh dead. I thought everything was
          going to nicely.

Driscoll looks at her downcast expression, wiggles
uncomfortably and at last blurts an attempt at consolation.

     DRISCOLL
          Aw, you're swell. Women can't help
          being a bother. I guess they're
          made that way.

Oddly enough, this doesn't cheer her up very much. But she
draws a long breath and smiles.

     ANN
          Well, anyhow, I've had the happiest
          time of my life on this old ship.

Driscoll is a little touched by this. He gives her a quick
look and says awkwardly -

     DRISCOLL
          Why - that's fine.

A little pause. Driscoll thinks it over.

     DRISCOLL
          D'ye really mean that, Ann?

     ANN
          Of course. Everyone's so nice to me
          - Mr. Denham and the Skipper -
          Don't you think the Skipper is a
          sweet old lamb?

     DRISCOLL
              (grinning)
          I'd hate to have him hear me say
          so.

Ann laughs and picks up Ignatz, the monkey, who cuddles down
in her lap contentedly.

     ANN
          Ignatz is nice to me too. He likes
          me better than he does anyone else
          on board, don't you Iggy?

Denham approaches them.

     DENHAM
          Beauty and the Beast.

     DRISCOLL
          Well, I never thought I was
          handsome, but -
              (they all laugh)

     DENHAM
          Go put on a costume, Ann. Light's
          good for those tests now.

     ANN
          I won't be a minute, Mr. Denham.

She puts down Ignatz and goes. Denham scratches Ignatz'
head, watches him for moment.

     DENHAM
              (half aloud)
          Beauty and the Beast.

     DRISCOLL
          Mr. Denham, I've going to do some
          butting-in.

     DENHAM
          What's your trouble, Driscoll?

     DRISCOLL
          When do we find out where we're
          going?

     DENHAM
              (smiling)
          Pretty soon now.

     DRISCOLL
          Are you going to tell us what
          happens when we get there?

     DENHAM
          How can I? I'm no fortune-teller.

     DRISCOLL
          But hang it, you must have some
          idea what you're after.

     DENHAM
          Going soft on me, Jack?

     DRISCOLL
          You know I'm not for myself. But
          Ann --

     DENHAM
          Oh you've gone soft on her? I've
          got enough on my hands without a
          love affair to complicate things.
          Better cut it out, Jack

     DRISCOLL
              (sullenly)
          Love affair! You think I'm going to
          fall for any dams?

     DENHAM
              (musing)
          It never fails. Some big hard
          boiled egg goes goofy over a pretty
          face, and bingo! He cracks up and
          gets sappy.

     DRISCOLL
              (angry)
          Who's getting sappy? I haven't run
          out on you, have I?

     DENHAM
          Nope. You're a good tough guy,
          Jack. But if beauty gets you --
              (he stops, then laughs a
little)
          Why, I'm going right into a theme
          song!

     DRISCOLL
              (sulky)
          What are you talking about?

     DENHAM
          It's the idea for my picture. The
          Beast was a tough guy, Jack. He
          could lick the world. But when he
          saw Beauty, she got him. He went
          soft, he forgot his wisdom, and the
          little fellers licked him. Think it
          over, Jack.

     SAILOR
              (coming up)
          Mr. Denham, the Skipper says will
          you please come up on the bridge?
          We've reached the position you
          marked, he says.

     DENHAM
          Come on, Jack. You're in on this.
          I'm going to spill it.

DISSOLVE TO bridge. Englehorn leaning over chart; Denham and
Driscoll across table.

     ENGLEHORN
              (pointing with dividers)
          Here's your noon position. 2 South,
          90 East; you promised me some
          information when we reached these
          latitudes.

     DENHAM
              (looking at chart)
          'Way west of Sumatra.

     ENGLEHORN
          And way out of any waters I know. I
          know the East Indies like my own
          hand, but I was never here.

     DRISCOLL
              (eagerly)
          Where do we go from here?

     DENHAM
          South-West.

     ENGLEHORN
          South-West! But there is nothing -
          nothing for thousands of miles.
          What about food? So many in the
          crew makes the food melt away. And
          water? And coal?

     DENHAM
          Take it easy, Skipper. We're not
          going thousands of miles.
              (he takes a wallet from
his breast pocket and
very carefully opens two
pieces of paper - spreads
over on table before
Englehorn)
          That's the island we're looking
          for.

     ENGLEHORN
          The position --
              (he leans down,
straightens up)
          I'll get the big chart.

     DENHAM
          You won't find that island on any
          chart. That one there was made up
          by the skipper of a Norwegian
          Barque.

     DRISCOLL
          He was kidding.

     DENHAM
          No. Listen. A canoe with natives
          from this island was blown out to
          sea. When the barque picked them
          up, there was only one alive. He
          died before they reached port, but
          not before the skipper had pieced
          together a description of the
          island and got a fairly good idea
          of where it lies.

     DRISCOLL
          Where did you get hold of it?

     DENHAM
          Two years ago, in Singapore, going
          home from my last trip. I've known
          that skipper for years. He knew I'd
          be interested.

     ENGLEHORN
          Does he believe it himself?

     DENHAM
          I don't know. But I do. See, here's
          what the island looks like.

He unfolds second piece of paper.

INSERT crude sketch of island, Denham's hand pointing to
various features. Float Denham's voice.

     DENHAM (V.O.)
          Here's a long sandy peninsula. The
          only possible landing place is
          through this reef. The rest of the
          shore-line is sheer precipice,
          hundreds of feet high. And across
          the base of that peninsula, cutting
          it off from the rest of the island,
          is a wall.

CUT TO Med. Shot - Denham, Driscoll, Englehorn. They stare
at Denham.

     ENGLEHORN
          A wall?

     DENHAM
          Built so long ago that the people
          who live there now have slipped
          back, forgotten the high
          civilization that built it. But
          it's as strong today as it was
          centuries ago. The natives keep
          that wall in repair. They need it.

     DRISCOLL
          Why?

     DENHAM
          There's something on the other side
          - something they fear.

     ENGLEHORN
          A hostile tribe.

     DENHAM
              (drawing a long breath)
          Did you ever hear of -- KONG?

     ENGLEHORN
              (thinking)
          Why -- yes. Some Malay
          superstition. A god or a spirit or
          something.

     DENHAM
          Anyway, neither beast nor man.
          Monstrous, all-powerful -- still
          living, still holding that island
          in the grip of deadly fear.

Englehorn and Driscoll look skeptical.

     DENHAM
          Every legend has a basis of truth.
          I tell you there's something on
          that island that no white man has
          ever seen.

     ENGLEHORN
          And you expect to photograph it?

     DENHAM
          If it's there, you bet I'll
          photograph it.

     DRISCOLL
              (very skeptical)
          Suppose it doesn't like having it's
          picture taken?

     DENHAM
          Well, now you know why I brought
          those cases of gas-bombs.

Driscoll and Englehorn stare at Denham, then look at each
other. Englehorn shrugs, reaches for the homemade chart.

DISSOLVE TO- Exterior forward deck of ship - Day. Denham has
camera set up. Ann comes in, in Beauty and Beast costume.

     DENHAM
          Oh, you picked out the Beauty and
          the Beast costume!

     ANN
          It's the prettiest.

     DENHAM
          All right. Stand over there.

     ANN
          I'm sort of nervous. Suppose I
          don't photograph well?

     DENHAM
              (busy with camera)
          Don't let that worry you.
          If I hadn't been sure of that, I
          wouldn't have brought you half way
          round the world.

     ANN
          What shall I do?

     DENHAM
              (squints through the
viewfinder, throws camera
over and locks it)
          Now when I start cranking hold it a
          minute, then turn slowly toward me.
          Look at me, look surprised, then
          smile a little, listen and then
          laugh. All right, camera.

She does as he has said.

CUT TO fo'c'sle head, several members of crew peering out,
watching with great interest. Charley among them.

     1ST SAILOR
          Looks kinda silly, don't it?

     2ND SAILOR
          She's sure a pretty dame.

     CHARLEY
          You think maybe he like take my
          picture, huh?

     1ST SAILOR
          Them camera cost money. Shouldn't
          think he'd risk it.

CUT TO Denham and Ann

     DENHAM
          That was fine. I'm going to try a
          filter on this one.
              (he fusses around,
changing lens, etc.)

     ANN
          Do you always take the pictures
          yourself?

     DENHAM
          Ever since a trip I made to Africa.
          I'd have got a swell picture of a
          charging rhino, but the cameraman
          got scared. The damned fool. I was
          right there with a rifle.
          Seemed he didn't trust me to get
          the rhino before it got him. I
          haven't fooled with cameramen
          since. Do the trick myself.

CUT TO the bridge. Englehorn and Driscoll leaning over,
watching Ann and Denham.

     DRISCOLL
          Think he's crazy, Skipper?

     ENGLEHORN
          Just enthusiastic!

     DRISCOLL
          But this yarn about unknown islands
          and monstrous gods --

     ENGLEHORN
          He pays us well to take him where
          he wants to go. If the island
          exists, we will find it.

CUT TO Denham and Ann.

     DENHAM
          Now Ann, stand there. Look down.
          When I start to crank, look up
          slowly. You're quite calm, don't
          expect to see anything. Follow my
          directions. All right -- camera.

He cranks. He gets more excited through this scene, trying
to force her to feel the emotions he wants.

     DENHAM
          Now -- look up. Slowly. You see
          nothing yet. Look higher. Still
          higher. That's it. Now you see it.
          You're amazed. You can't believe
          it. Your eyes open wider. It's
          horrible, but you can't look away.
          What is it Ann? What can you do?
          No chances for you, no escape.
          Helpless, Ann, you're helpless. One
          chance -- if you can scream. Your
          throat's paralyzed. Try to scream,
          Ann. Try. If you didn't see,
          perhaps you could scream. Throw you
          arms across your eyes, and scream,
          Ann, scream for your life!

She has followed his directions.

CUT TO bridge. Driscoll and Englehorn, watching Denham and
Ann. Ann's scream floats.

     DRISCOLL
              (grasping Englehorn's arm)
          What's he think she's really going
          to see?

              DISSOLVE OUT

FADE IN, bridge in fog, outside wheel-house. Denham, Ann,
Driscoll, Englehorn, at rail peering ahead. Through this
dialogue intercut shots of look-out in bow, man in crows
nest, sailor heaving lead, and sailors clustered at bulwarks
on main deck, watching for island.

     DENHAM
          This infernal fog! Sure of your
          position, Skipper?

     ENGLEHORN
              (very nervous, but
offended at suggestion)
          Of course. Last night, before the
          fog shut down, I got a good sight.

     DENHAM
          We must be near the island.

     DRISCOLL
          If we don't see it when this fog
          lifts we never shall. We've
          quartered these parts.

CUT TO sailor with lead. He lets go, line runs through his
hand.

     SAILOR
          No bottom at 30 fathoms!

CUT TO bridge as before.

     DRISCOLL
              (nervous)
          Of course that Norwegian skipper
          was guessing at the position.

     ANN
          How will we know it's the right
          island?

     DENHAM
              (very tense, answering
mechanically)
          The mountain that looks like a
          skull.

     ANN
          Yes. I'd forgotten. You told me
          that. Skull Mountain.

     SAILOR'S VOICE
          Bottom! 20 fathoms!

     ENGLEHORN
          Shallowing fast, Driscoll, dead
          slow.

Driscoll goes to telegraph, sounds of bells to engine-room
and reply.

     DENHAM
          Curse the fog!

     SAILOR'S VOICE
          Sixteen fathoms!

     DENHAM
          What does she draw, Skipper?

     ENGLEHORN
          Six.

No one ever looks at person addressed. All eyes ahead,
straining through fog.

     DRISCOLL
          Listen! Hear anything?

     DENHAM
          No.

     ANN
          No.

There is a slight pause.

     MAN IN CROWS NEST
          Breakers ahead!

Englehorn jumps for telegraph.

     SAILOR'S VOICE
          Ten fathoms!

Jingle of telegraph, noise of reversing engines.

     DRISCOLL
              (bellowing at fo'c'sle)
          Let go!

Rattle of anchor chain through hawse-pipe, splash of anchor,
more jingle of telegraph. After noise dies down, Driscoll
speaks:

     DRISCOLL
          That's not breakers. That's drums.

A long distant mutter of drums rolling. DISSOLVE TO:

Boats being lowered, Bos'n giving orders.

CUT TO bridge, Englehorn with binocular. Denham, Ann and
Driscoll.

     DENHAM
          Well, Skipper, see anybody?

     ENGLEHORN
          Not a living thing. I think there
          are more houses in the thick bush.

     DENHAM
          Funny they haven't spotted us. I
          think the whole population would be
          on the beach.

     ENGLEHORN
          Listen.

The faint throbbing of drums.

     DENHAM
          Maybe they have seen us and are
          signalling. Well, Skipper, do you
          believe me now? There's Skull
          Mountain, the wall - everything
          just like my funny map. Come on,
          let's get started.

     ENGLEHORN
          Twelve men go with you. The rest
          stay aboard.

     DENHAM
          Who's in charge of the gas bombs?

     ENGLEHORN
          Jimmy. That young feller.
              (points down on deck)

     DENHAM
          Good. Leave the 2nd Mate aboard,
          Skipper. I need you, you may be
          able to talk to these birds ashore.

     ANN
          I'm going ashore with you, aren't
          I?

     DENHAM
          You bet.

     DRISCOLL
          She ought not to go till we find
          out what goes on --

     DENHAM
              (good-naturedly)
          Say, who's running this show? I've
          learned by experience to keep my
          cast and my cameras right with me.
          You never can tell when you'll want
          'em.

     DRISCOLL
          But it's crazy to risk --

     DENHAM
          Oh, go on, Jack. Get busy. Deal out
          the rifles and ammunition. And pick
          me a couple of huskies to carry my
          stuff.

Driscoll goes reluctantly. Denham shakes his head over him,
then Ann.

     DENHAM
          Bring the costume box. We might get
          a swell shot right away if we're
          lucky.

DISSOLVE TO shot of beach, boats approaching. Village and
wall glassed.

DISSOLVE TO shot from beach, showing loaded boats
approaching.

Drums louder, of course.

CUT TO boats beaching, people getting out, uploading stuff.

Denham puts camera on tripod, one sailor shoulders it,
another with magazine case, third with costume box, fourth
and fifth with trade-goods in boxes. Jimmy with case of
bombs.

     DENHAM
          You fellers with the camera stay
          close to me. Where's Jimmy with the
          bombs?

     JIMMY
          Here, sir.

     DENHAM
          All right. Stick around. And watch
          your step. There's enough
          trichloride in that case to put a
          herd of hippos to sleep.

     JIMMY
          Aye Aye, sir.

     ANN
          What queer-looking boats.

     DRISCOLL
          Outrigger canoes.

     ENGLEHORN
          Driscoll, have two men stay with
          the boat.

     DRISCOLL
          All attended to, sir.

     DENHAM
              (grinning)
          Now, all set? Ready, Skipper?

     ENGLEHORN
              (coming up)
          Ready.

They start up the beach.

CUT TO village. Wall visible over roofs. Party enters.

Drums much louder.

     ENGLEHORN
          Not a soul in sight.

     DENHAM
          That wall, Skipper! What d'ye say
          to that, eh?

     ENGLEHORN
          Colossal! It might almost be
          Egyptian.

     DENHAM
          But what's on the other side?
          That's what I want to know.

     ANN
              (awe-struck)
          Who do you suppose could have built
          it?

     DRISCOLL
              (trying not to be
impressed)
          Aw, I went up to Angkor once.
          That's bigger than this - and
          nobody knows who built it.

     DENHAM
              (with a feeling of
something even more
important than a picture
pending, but trying to
strike his usual note)
          Oh, boy! What a chance! What a
          picture!

The chant begins, rising in volume. They all stand frozen.

Ann clutches Driscoll's arm. Sailors frightened. Chant dies
down to a mutter.

     DENHAM
              (shaking himself)
          Come on!

They all move forward cautiously. TRUCK WITH THEM.

     DENHAM
          Hear that! They're saying Kong!
          Kong!

     DRISCOLL
          Hope you'll be able to speak their
          lingo Skipper.

     DENHAM
          Can you catch any words yet?

     ENGLEHORN
          I'm not sure. It sounds something
          like the language the Nias
          Islanders speak.

     ANN
          What do you suppose is happening?

     DRISCOLL
          Up to some of their heathen tricks.
          Now don't go rushing out to see.

     ANN
              (meekly, but bubbling with
excitement)
          All right. But isn't it exciting!

     DRISCOLL
          Sure. I wish we'd left you on the
          ship.

     ANN
          I'm so glad you didn't.

They approach masking house.

     DENHAM
          Wait. Easy row. Stay here till I
          see what goes on.

They stop in a group behind house. Denham looks round
cautiously.

CUT TO what he sees. The Ceremony.

     DENHAM
          Holy mackerel! What a show!
          Skipper, get a look at this!

Englehorn carefully goes forward and peeps around.

     DENHAM
          Did you ever see anything like that
          before? If I can steal a shot
          before they see us -

He beckons to sailor carrying camera.

     DENHAM
          Hey! You with the camera!

Sailor starts forward with it.

     ANN
              (to Driscoll)
          I want to see.

     ENGLEHORN
          Come on and look, but be careful.

Ann looks around house. Denham moves beyond and starts
setting up. Chant begins to rise. As it reaches forte, Chief
sees them and shouts.

     CHIEF
          Bado! Dama pati vego!

Ceremony stops, natives turn and stare.

     DENHAM
          Too late, they see us.

     JIMMY
          Let's beat it!

He turns to run. Driscoll seizes and holds him.

     DRISCOLL
          Hold on there! What are you running
          for?

     DENHAM
          No use trying to hide now.
          Everybody come out here in plain
          sight. Put up a bold front.

Driscoll, Ann and sailors come forward in a group a few
paces behind Denham and Englehorn.

     CHIEF
          Bado! Maka mini tau ansaro.(Wait!
          Two warriors come with me.)

In silence, the Chief with two warriors close behind him
advances through the crowd of natives. The women in the
crowd begin to slip away.

The group of whites watch in tense silence the approach of
the Chief.

     2ND SAILOR
          Say, let's scram outa this.

     DRISCOLL
          Stand still, you fool!

Group of sailors are fingering their rifles, shifting
nervously.

     DENHAM
              (over his shoulder without
looking away from Chief)
          Steady, boys. Don't get nervous.

Ann takes hold of Driscoll's arm. He puts his hand on hers
without looking at her.

     DRISCOLL
          Never let a native see you're
          worried, boys. Bluff 'em.

The chief stops.

     CHIEF
          Watu! Tama di? Tama di? (Stop! Who
          are you? Who are you?)

     DENHAM
          Come on Skipper, make him a
          friendly speech.
              (advance)

     ENGLEHORN
              (slowly)
          Tabe! Bala kum nono hi. Bala! Bala!
          (Greeting! We are your friends.
          Friends! Friends!)

     CHIEF
              (sternly)
          Bala reri! Tasko! Tasko! (We don't
          want friends, Go! Get out!

     DENHAM
          He understands you, Skipper! What's
          he say?

     ENGLEHORN
          Telling us to get out.

     DENHAM
          Talk him out of it. Ask him what
          goes on.

     ENGLEHORN
          Vana di humya? Malem ani humya
          vana? (What are you doing? What is
          that woman doing?)
              (he points to girl)

     CHIEF
          Ani saba Kong! (She is the bride of
          Kong!)

The natives all murmur "Saba Kong!"

     ENGLEHORN
          He says the girl there is the bride
          of Kong.

     DENHAM
          Great! Find out what they're going
          to do.

The Witch Doctor rushes forward, very angry. He addresses
Chief.

     WITCH DOCTOR
          Dama si kasi! Dama si kasi! Punya
          bas! Punya! (Strangers have seen!
          It is finished.)

     CHIEF
              (to Englehorn)
          Tasko! (Go!)

     DENHAM
          What's that?

     ENGLEHORN
          He must be the witch-doctor. He
          says the ceremony is spoiled
          because we have seen it.

     DENHAM
          What's the word for friends?

     ENGLEHORN
          Bala.

     DENHAM
          Calm the old boy down.

He advances with outspread hands, saying, "Bala! Bala!"

Englehorn hesitates for a moment, then steps forward too.

     CHIEF
              (bellowing)
          Punya!

The warriors move menacingly forward.

     ENGLEHORN
          I don't like the looks of this,
          Denham. The women have cleared out.
          That's a bad sign.

The Chief sees Ann.

     CHIEF
              (shouting to the natives)
          Sita! Malem! Malem me pakeno!
          (Look! The woman! The woman of
          gold!)

Natives all look at her and murmur.

     DENHAM
          What's that?

     ENGLEHORN
          He says look at the golden woman.

     DENHAM
          Blondes are scarce around here.

     CHIEF
          Malem ma pakapo! Kong wa bisa! Kow
          bisa para Kong! (The woman of gold!
          Kong's gift! A gift for Kong.)

     ENGLEHORN
          A gift for Kong, he says.

     DENHAM
          Good Lord!

     CHIEF
          Dama, tebo malem na hi? (Strangers,
          sell woman to us?)

     ENGLEHORN
          Wants to buy her.

     CHIEF
          Sani sita malem ati -
              (pointing to sacrificial
victim)
          - kow dia malem ma pakeno.
          (I will give six women like this
          for you woman of gold.)

     ENGLEHORN
          He's offering to trade us six of
          his girls for Ann.

Ann gasps, tries to smile.

     DRISCOLL
          You got her into this, Denham.

     ENGLEHORN
          Tida, tida! Malem ati rota na hi.
          (No, no! Our woman stays with us.)

Chief growls menacingly. Warriors take another step forward.
Sailors finger their rifles.

     DRISCOLL
          I'm going to take her back to the
          ship.

     ENGLEHORN
          We'd better all get out before they
          think to cut us off from the beach.

     DENHAM
          I guess so. But tell him we'll come
          back tomorrow to make friends.

     ENGLEHORN
          Dulu hi tego. Bala. Dulu. (Tomorrow
          we come. Friends. Tomorrow.)

Chief does not move, glares at them.

     DENHAM
          Get going, Ann. Don't act scared.
          Everything's all right. Smile, Ann.
          Talk to Jack. Keep your chin up!

Ann, very frightened, but smiling gallantly, does as he tell
her. She and Driscoll retreat slowly, pretending unconcern.
The sailors fall back one by one, Englehorn and Denham last.

Denham cocks his hat over one eye and begins to whistle
carelessly, one hand on his revolver. As they reach the
corner of masking house.

DISSOLVE TO deck in moonlight - Ann and Charley on hatch.

     ANN
          -- and an enormous wall, Charley,
          all the way across that piece of
          land where we went ashore.

     CHARLEY
          What fashion that girl do -- that
          girl with flowers on her?

     ANN
          The poor thing, she looked -- as
          though she was too frightened to
          feel frightened. You know?

     CHARLEY
              (nodding wisely)
          Sacrifice.

     ANN
          The Chief said she was the bride of
          Kong. Charley, what do you suppose
          Kong is?

     CHARLEY
          My guess he very big joss this
          place. People here plenty scared.
          You don't worry. No can help.

Ignatz gallops past.

     ANN
          Oh, there's Ignatz! He's broken
          loose again.

Charley grabs at him and misses. Ignatz goes down the deck.

     ANN
          Catch him, Charley. He'll get in
          the cabins and break things.

     CHARLEY
          My catch him. Bad devil, come here.

He goes off in pursuit. Ann watches, laughing.

CUT TO Sailor on watch in bow. He looks round, yawns, sits
down and makes himself comfortable.

CUT TO Ann on hatch. Driscoll enters.

     DRISCOLL
          Why aren't you in bed?

     ANN
          I can't sleep. Those drums make me
          nervous, I guess.

     DRISCOLL
          I think Denham's off his nut,
          taking you ashore today.

     ANN
          I was -- sort of scared there for a
          while.

     DRISCOLL
          Huh! You weren't the only one.

     ANN
          I wonder what we do next?

     DRISCOLL
          That's what's worrying me. Denham's
          such a fool for risks. No telling
          what he'll ask you to do.

     ANN
          After what he did for me, I'll do
          anything he wants.

     DRISCOLL
          Don't talk like that. When it comes
          to getting a picture, he's crazy
          enough to try anything.

     ANN
          I won't go back on him.

     DRISCOLL
          When I think what might have
          happened today -- if anything
          happened to you.

     ANN
              (laughing)
          Why then you wouldn't be bothered
          with a woman on board.

     DRISCOLL
              (very staccato)
          Don't laugh. I'm scared for you.
          I'm sort of - I'm scared of you,
          too. Ann, I -- I guess I love you.

They look at each other, both startled by this conclusion.

     ANN
          Jack! You hate women!

     DRISCOLL
              (still surprised over his
discovery)
          You aren't -- women. I love you.
          Ann, I don't suppose -- you don't
          feel like that about me -- do you?

Ann looks at him soberly for a moment, then takes a step
nearer.

Just as his arms go around her, a hail from the bridge.

     ENGLEHORN'S VOICE
          Mr. Driscoll! Are you on deck?

     DRISCOLL
              (lifts his head long
enough to reply)
          Yes, sir.
              (then bends over Ann
again)

     ENGLEHORN'S VOICE
          Please come up here a minute.

     DRISCOLL
              (same business)
          Yes, sir.

     ANN
          I'll wait here for you.

Driscoll kisses her once more and goes reluctantly.

Ann leans back against the bulwarks with a happy smile,
looking after him.

The Witch Doctor rises noiselessly behind her, and without a
sound she is seized and lifted over the rail.

THE BRIDGE. NIGHT. Englehorn, Denham, Driscoll - talking
over chart table.

     DENHAM
          Now tomorrow morning, pick out the
          men to go ashore. Couple of those
          nervous boys you better leave
          aboard.

     ENGLEHORN
          Mr. Denham wants you to break out
          the trade goods the first thing
          tomorrow.

     DENHAM
          We'll try a little bribery.

     DRISCOLL
          Still hoping to make friends with
          that bunch ashore?

     DENHAM
          Sure. We've got to. I've got to
          find out what Kong is.

     ENGLEHORN
              (impatiently)
          He's their tribal legend, their
          god, of course.

     DRISCOLL
          You planning to make movies of a
          fairy story?

     DENHAM
          How do you know Kong's only a
          legend or a fairy story? That wall
          wasn't built for fun.

     DRISCOLL
          But you said yourself it was built
          so long ago the people who live
          here now don't know anything about
          it.

     DENHAM
          Yes, but they've kept it in damn
          good repair. Did you see how those
          gates were fastened? They're meant
          to keep something out.

Englehorn and Driscoll exchange skeptical looks.

Noise of drums increase suddenly.

     ENGLEHORN
              (looks at watch)
          After ten. And they're still at is
          ashore.

     DENHAM
          If I could only take pictures by
          firelight! I'd sneak back there now
          and get a scene.

     ENGLEHORN
              (exasperated)
          Be sensible. We're lucky to be all
          safe aboard tonight.

     DENHAM
          Oh sure, sure.

He looks to Driscoll, who has crossed over and is peering
down onto the deck.

     DENHAM
          What is is, Jack?

     DRISCOLL
          Oh -- er -- I was looking for Ann.
          She's gone below, I guess.

     DENHAM
          How about turning in, Skipper?

     ENGLEHORN
          No, not for me tonight.

     DENHAM
          But you've set a watch in the bow.

Englehorn shakes his head stubbornly. Driscoll starts to go.

     DENHAM
          Oh well, I'll sit up with you then.

     ENGLEHORN
          Mr. Driscoll, I wish you'd take a
          star sight. See how our position
          checks up with what I got last
          night before we ran into the fog.

Driscoll gets out the instruments.

     DRISCOLL
              (reluctantly)
          Yes sir. I guess it's been a long
          time since the map-makers got a
          brand new island to put down.

DISSOLVE TO Charley, on afterdeck, tying Ignatz and scolding
him in Chinese. Ignatz chattering and scolding right back at
him. SHOT of bow watch, having a peaceful nap.

DISSOLVE TO Bridge, interior - Englehorn and Driscoll
bending over chart, making calculations. Denham half asleep
in a chair.

     ENGLEHORN
          That's about it.
              (marking chart)
          We'll make absolutely sure tomorrow
          noon.

Denham yawns, stretches, looks at watch, crosses and looks
toward shore.

     DENHAM
          About midnight. Hey, look at that.

     ENGLEHORN
              (crosses and looks)
          Torches going through the village.

Driscoll exits.

     DENHAM
          Looks like the night before
          election.

Noise of drums increases suddenly.

     DENHAM
          Listen to 'em, will you? Wonder
          what's up.

CUT TO main deck. Driscoll speaking to Charley.

     CHARLEY
          My don't know, sir. My not see
          Missy one, two hour.

     DRISCOLL
          Guess, she's in her cabin.

He goes off. Charley takes a long round deck, sees something
near rail. Goes over, picks it up. A native bracelet of
woven straw. He examines it for a moment, suddenly realizes
what it means, jumps and shouts.

     CHARLEY
          On deck! On deck!

He stamps frantically on deck, turns and runs for the
bridge.

Man on watch in bow runs to rail of fo'c'sle head and
shouts.

     SAILOR IN BOW
          All hands on deck!

CUT TO bridge. Charley runs into Englehorn and Denham.

     CHARLEY
          Look sir! My found on deck.

     ENGLEHORN
          A native bracelet!

     CHARLEY
          Crazy black man that place comes
          this place!

Driscoll arrives on the run.

     DRISCOLL
          Who's turning out the crew? What's
          the matter?

     ENGLEHORN
          Charley found this. Some one's been
          aboard. Search the ship.

Charley exits.

     DRISCOLL
          Oh my God! Where's Ann?

     DENHAM
          In her cabin -

     DRISCOLL
          No, she isn't! I just looked.

He rushes out. Confused sound of sailors' voices from deck
below. Englehorn leans from wheel-house window, shouts down.

     ENGLEHORN
          Bos'n!

     BOS'N'S VOICE
              (from below)
          Yes sir.

     ENGLEHORN
          Man the boats. Serve out the
          rifles. Search the ship.

     BOS'N'S VOICE
          Yes sir.

Bos'n's whistle is heard, creak and thump of davits.
Englehorn takes his revolver from chart-table drawer,
examines it, puts it in his pocket.

          Kong. (The bride is here, O Mighty

     DRISCOLL
          He's got Ann! Who's coming with me?

     1ST SAILOR
          I'll go.

     2ND SAILOR
          Sure. Me too.

     3RD SAILOR
          I'm going, sir.

     DRISCOLL
          All right. Here you - and you -
              (selecting sailors)

     DENHAM
          What did you see?

     DRISCOLL
              (brushing him aside)
          Skipper, you stay here with half
          the men and guard this gate. Don't
          let 'em close it.

     DENHAM
          Who's got the bombs?

Jimmy comes forward.

     DRISCOLL
          Come on, you fellers.

Driscoll, Denham and eleven sailors start through gate.

LAP DISSOLVE



EXT. JUNGLE - FULL OR MED. SHOT

PAN to follow the men, headed by Driscoll and Denham as they
plunge through the jungle; left to right. (NOTE: This along
top of ledge-crevasse set, not showing edge.)



EXT. JUNGLE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

CRANE TO FOLLOW as they come up the ledge. A twittering of
birds and insects' noises. Ad lib as they come: "Watch that
log" -- "Shove right on through." Men go left to right.

     DENHAM
              (stops, wipes his
forehead)
          No telling where he's gone in this
          darkness.

     DRISCOLL
          He came by here. Look at those
          broken branches.

     DENHAM
          That's right. He's up ahead
          somewhere.

     DRISCOLL
              (looks about)
          The sun ought to be rising about
          now.

     DENHAM
          Listen to those birds.
              (bird noises)
          It's dawn all right.

     DRISCOLL
          Look here.

He points to one of Kong's great footprints; just visible as
a first shaft of dawn light strikes down between the trees.

CRANE TO CLOSE. All move forward - TRUCK TO FOLLOW

To look at Kong's footprint. Probably no close up necessary.
Ad lib murmurs together, "Get that" - "It's tracks" - "Look
here, Jo."

     DENHAM
          Look at the size of that. He must
          be as big as a house. He's come
          this way, all right.

     DRISCOLL
          And he's heading that way. Come on.

TRUCK to LONGER SHOT as he leads them forward. All hasten on
after Kong.

     DENHAM
              (to sailors)
          Keep those guns cocked.

     SAILOR IN BLACK SWEATER
          He's telling us!

As they exit, camera left - DISSOLVE OUT.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

As the men come from the edge of the jungle, last fringe of
shrubbery masking foreground, to look out upon an open
glade.
They pause, as they see broken shrubbery. It is now full
dawn. Use "Most Dangerous Game" ledge set, men coming
towards camera.

     DRISCOLL
          That's right. We're on his trail.

He leads them forward out into -



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The open glade. Kong's footsteps is visible in soft earth
again.

     DRISCOLL
              (sees footprints, points,
shouts back without
stopping)
          There!

All hurry forward in a dog trot. A couple of sailors,
running, pass Driscoll, then stop, run back into the arms of
the others.

     SAILORS
          Look out! Look out!

They point and all stop as they see --

An immense spike-tailed beast coming through the jungle
parallel with them, partially masked by trees. Men in
foreground here. (Williams Process)

     DENHAM
          Great Scott, that's something I
          didn't know about.

     DRISCOLL
          I got an idea there's plenty on
          this island you weren't figuring
          on.

The beast crashes out into the open.

     DENHAM
          Gimme one of those bombs.

ONE ANGLE ONLY

He snatches a bomb from the sailor who is carrying them.



EXT. GLADE - DAWN

The beast charges. The men run. Only Driscoll and Denham
stand their ground. Driscoll fires several times without
effect. This should be a very wide glade to get the full
effect of a long charge.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The first angle at edge of glade, with Denham and Driscoll
in the foreground, other men running back.

     DRISCOLL

Denham throws his bomb.



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

FIRST ANGLE - the sailors run forward to --



EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

Join Driscoll and Denham. They start forward towards the
beast. It is in the background. (Projection)

     DENHAM
          Wait a minute. He's only knocked
          out.

He takes a gun from one of the men and goes forward to the
great beast's head. He shoots it through the ear. It's
starts convulsing, then grows rigid.

     DENHAM
              (after a look, speaks to
Driscoll)
          I told you those gas bombs would
          bring down anything. We'll get that
          ape alive.

     DRISCOLL
          We're not trying to catch the ape -
          we're trying to save that girl.
          Come on - we're losing time.

He leads them off towards --



LAP DISSOLVE - EXT. STREAM - FULL SHOT - DAY

DISSOLVE IN on the exterior of a bank, leading, in the
background down into a hollow filled with fog. The men come
in from camera left and look down. (Fog Hollow set from
"most
Dangerous Game")

     DENHAM
              (following tracks with
eyes)
          There's his foot again --
              (following director)
          -- he's down in that hollow where
          the fog is, some place.

     DRISCOLL
              (looks)
          There's water down there. Here.

They listen. Sounds of splashing.

     DENHAM
          That's him, splashing through. Come
          on.

They run down into fog. (CURTAIN EFFECT)



EXT. STREAM - FULL SHOT - DAY

The men run down the muddy bank through heavy fog towards
the water, left to right. (Fog Hollow set)

be
heard as men come up. (Fog Hollow Set)

     DRISCOLL
              (looks at footprint, then
across stream)
          He must have swum across.

     DENHAM
          That's out for us. We can't swim
          with guns and bombs.

     DRISCOLL
              (looks about, sees log,
gets an idea)
          How about these --
              (indicates logs)
          -- for a raft?

     DENHAM
          Yeah, that's it. A raft.

     DRISCOLL
          All right, boys, gets busy.

     1ST SAILOR
          Get some vines, Tim.

Tim, the sailor to be used in tree, runs for vines. Other
sailors run to logs.

              (guarding them)
          I'm watching 'em.

     SAILOR B
              (helping another on)
          Easy now.

     DRISCOLL

          All set? All set, everybody?

     SAILORS
          All set. Let 'er go.

     TOGETHER
          O.K.

     DRISCOLL
          Shove off.

A couple of sailors; still on shore, push the raft out until
they are waist deep, then jump aboard. Others use poles to
push it towards the opposite bank. Ad lib, "Push -- put your
back in it, etc."



EXT. STREAM - GENERAL VIEW - DAY

The raft moves across the stream through heavy fog.
(Miniature raft and miniature men.)



EXT. STREAM - FULL OR MED. SHOT - DAY

          Keep your weight in the center,
          boys -- weight in the center.

     1ST SAILOR
              (stops poling to stare)
          Holy mackerel -- look at that.

All look.



EXT. STREAM - LONG SHOT - DAY

A huge scaly head rears up from the water to look down on

     DENHAM
          I can't get across now.

          I don't want you to. You got to lam
          back for some more of them bombs.

     DRISCOLL
          Someone's got to keep on his trail

          I don't I'll figure some way to
          signal your party where he's taken
          her.



EXT. LOG - FULL SHOT - DAY

          don't get croaked till you give the
          office to Englehorn.

He is unaware that the boy is following him. He enters this
fissure with the girl.



INT. CAVERN - GENERAL VIEW - DAY

A great black pool lies at camera right. Entrance as at
back.
It has an outlet through the rock through which the water
pours out in a waterfall. Steep walls of rock rise to an
immense height all around. A trail leads up camera left to a
ledge high above. This ledge looks out upon an opening
through which daylight pours. It is this daylight which
faintly illuminates the subterranean depths below. Kong
enters with the girl, passes along the camera left side of
the pool towards the trail.

The head of the monster rears out the pool. He stares at
Kong, who can be seen starting up the path which leads
towards the ledge above. The monster lunges for the shore
and
starts to glide up the trail after Kong.

Driscoll enters in the background and at once dunks behind a
rock.

Kong places the girl on a small ledge beside the trail to
his
lair. He plunges down over the side of his lair, with a
roar,
to attack the sea monster. Eve Ann is in the foreground of
this shot, on the ledge.

Instantly, the water monster winds himself about Kong and
draws him toward the pool.

Kong fights to keep himself from being drawn into the pool
by
the monster, whose tail has a purchase in the bottom of the
water somewhere. He grips rocks with his feet, locks his
great arms about the monster, crushing him, sinking his
teeth
into the monster's body. The monster in turn winds his coils
about the great ape trying to crush him. After a few moments
of frantic struggle, accompanied by hideous noises, both
lapse into low grunts and hisses as each exerts strength
against the other.

It is a question of which will be crushed first. Driscoll in
the foreground or background of this shot. As the monsters,
locked in a death embrace, grow still, hardly moving at all,
FADE OUT.

FADE IN. THE GREAT GATE - NIGHT - Sailors on guard.
Englehorn, 2nd Mate and others in group round Denham who is
sitting on the ground, torn, dishevelled, still panting.

     DENHAM
          --Skipper, I tell you this Kong is
          the biggest thing on earth.
          He shook the men off that log like
          flies.

     ENGLEHORN
          All those men lost! Incredible!

     DENHAM
          Driscoll said he'd try to signal us
          when he found Ann.

     ENGLEHORN
              (groans)
          We'll never see either of them
          again.

     2ND MATE
          Don't give up, Skipper. There's
          still a chance for Driscoll.

     DENHAM
          We'll have to wait for daylight.
          Then we'll bridge the ravine.
          Where's that other case of bombs?

     SAILOR
          Here, sir.

     ENGLEHORN
          This--this monster that you saw,
          will he care for bombs.

     DENHAM
          If we can get near enough to use
          'em, you bet he'll care. Had any
          trouble with the natives?

     ENGLEHORN
          Yes, just after you left.

     DENHAM
          What happened?

     ENGLEHORN
          We fired a couple volleys over
          their heads, and they took to their
          huts like scared rabbits.

     DENHAM
          Gunpowder's something new in their
          lives, huh?

     ENGLEHORN
          They're terrified.

     2ND MATE
          They've kept under cover ever
          since.

     DENHAM
              (to 2nd Mate)
          Briggs, get up on the wall and keep
          your eyes peeled. We'll start at
          dawn, whether we get a signal for
          Driscoll or not.

          Wait a minute. What about Kong?

     DRISCOLL
          What about him?

     DENHAM
          We came here to make a moving
          picture, but we've found something
          worth all the movies in the world.

     ENGLEHORN
              (can't believe his ears)
          What!

     DENHAM
          We've got the bombs. If we capture
          him alive --

     DRISCOLL
          You're crazy. Anyway, he's on top
          of a cliff where an army couldn't
          get at him.

     DENHAM
          If he chooses to stay there.

They all stare at him.

     DENHAM
          We've got something he wants.

He looks at Ann. She shrinks in horror.

     DRISCOLL
              (furiously)
          Something he won't get again.

The roar of KONG is heard in the jungle.

     DRISCOLL
          He's followed us!

Ann screams, Driscoll puts arms round her.



EXT. ALTAR - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

Kong bursts from the jungle. Sees them and beats his breast.



EXT. ALTAR - GENERAL VIEW - NIGHT

All run for the gate.



EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - GENERAL VIEW - NIGHT

This SHOT shooting towards village street, as native
warriors, alarmed at sound of Kong - which can be heard -
come running towards gate with weapons in hand.



EXT. WALL - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

The sailors at the gate hear the natives running up behind
them and snatch up weapons, ready to defend themselves. The
natives, however, run up, holding their hands, with weapons
above their heads, to show no harm is meant, shouting "KONG,
KONG," and indicating with gestures that the gate must be
closed. Some start to pick up the big pole used to keep the
gate shut. Before the sailors have time to ask questions,
another frightful roar and drumming is heard beyond the
wall.



EXT. ALTAR - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

EXT. WALL - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

The party who went to meet the boy and girl, with boy and
girl, run through the gate, past natives and sailors.

     DENHAM
              (shouts)
          Shut the gate - shut the gate.

     ENGLEHORN
          All hands on the gate.

     2ND MATE
              (blows whistle)

Driscoll runs straight on out of the shot, with Ann, towards
village square. The sailors drop their weapons to push the
gate closed. The native warriors, who picked up the big
pole, now push it against the gate - some sixty of them
on it. A few others stand by with weapons - leaders,
evidently - shouting orders and encouragements.



EXT. ALTAR - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

REVERSE ANGLE - Kong, in the foreground, pursues the people

EXT. ALTAR - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

Kong throws himself repeatedly against the gate. It begins
to wrench loose.



EXT. WALL - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

The sailors press against the gate. They look up, horrified
as they see --



EXT. WALL - SEMI CLOSE UP OR MED. SHOT - NIGHT

--the hinges above tearing loose.



EXT. WALL - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

They redouble their efforts to keep the gate shut.



EXT. ALTAR - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

Kong makes one last lunge at the gate. It rips loose from
its hinges --



EXT. ALTAR - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

-- and falls in. The sixty natives on the long pole are
crushed. The sailors run for their lives. They have no time
to pick up weapons. The few surviving natives with spears -
the one's nor on pole - also run. Kong stands in the gate,
snarling, beating his chest. He starts after them.

Village street, sailors panicking through, taking refuge in
huts.

Driscoll and Ann run across, behind huts. Denham runs in.

     DENHAM
          The bombs! Who's got the bombs!

KONG advances down street, towering over huts. He roars and
knocks huts aside.

Men in foreground run.

Bombs burst in front of KONG. Smoke veils him.

KONG staggers forward through smoke, coughing. He knocks
Denham aside with his hand.

He reaches for Driscoll and Ann, and pitches forward.

CLOSE SHOT, Driscoll and Ann. KONG'S reaching hand falls
into
this shot, and he's limp.

Village street. Night. Englehorn and Denham.

     ENGLEHORN
          Are you hurt?

     DENHAM
              (gets up, pushes Englehorn
aside)
          Come on. We've got him.

Village street. Night. KONG's great side, heaving as he
breathes. All crowd around him.

     DENHAM
              (exultant)
          He'll be out for hours. Send off to
          the ship for anchor-chain, Skipper.
          And tools.

     ENGLEHORN
          What are you going to do?

     DENHAM
          Build a raft to float him out to
          the ship. The whole world'll pay to
          see this!

     ENGLEHORN
          No chains will hold -- that.

     DENHAM
          We'll give him more than chains.
          He's always been king of the world.
          But we'll teach him fear.
              (his voice rises
triumphantly)
          We're millionaires. I'll share with
          all of you. Listen, boys a few
          months from now it'll be in lights
          on Broadway -- Kong, the Eight
          Wonder.

DISSOLVE TO electric sign on a theatre, "KONG, the Eight
Wonder."

Tilt down to crowds outside.

CLOSEUPS of crowd.

     1ST MAN
          What is it, anyhow?

     2ND MAN
          They say it's sort of a gorilla.

     1ST MAN
          Gee, ain't we got enough of them in
          New York?

Another close-up.

     YOUNG MAN
              (to his girl)
          I hear it's bigger'n an elephant.

     GIRL
              (chewing gum)
          Does it do tricks or what?

Another close-up.

     WOMAN
              (in evening dress)
          Heavens, what a mob.

     HER HUSBAND
          Well, you would come. And the
          tickets cost me twenty bucks.

Long Shot of crowd, zoom forward over their heads toward the
entrance.

Dissolve to wings of theatre, shoot toward stage. Ann and
Driscoll in foreground, peering toward stage. Ann evening
dress. Driscoll dinner jacket.

     ANN
          I don't like to look at him, Jack.
          It makes me feel the way I did that
          awful day on the island.

     DRISCOLL
          I wouldn't have brought you, but
          you know how Denham insisted.

     ANN
          Of course we had to come when he
          said it would help the show. Do you
          suppose we'll really make a lot of
          money, Jack?

     DRISCOLL
              (fussing with his collar)
          Enough to pay him back for these
          clothes, anyway...I never had an
          open-face suit before.

Denham bustles in. Full evening dress, silk hat, gardenia.
He
is excited and important.

     DENHAM
          Hello, you're just on time. You
          look great, Ann. Glad I dressed you
          up for this show. Hello, Jack. Ten
          thousand dollars in the box office.
          How's that for one night?

     DRISCOLL
          Say! That's money!

     DENHAM
          Oh, we're going to do that every
          night. The newspaper boys are
          coming in now.

Group of reporters and photographers come in to Ann,
Driscoll, and Denham.

     DENHAM
          Miss Darrow, boys. And Mr.
          Driscoll.

     1ST REPORTER
          It was Mr. Driscoll rescued you
          from the ape, wasn't it?

     ANN
          Yes. He was alone. All the sailors
          with him had been killed.

     2ND REPORTER
              (looking off-stage)
          Alone, eh? Whew! How did you tackle
          that baby?

     DRISCOLL
          Aw, Denham's the one that got him.
          The rest of us were running like
          rabbits, but Denham had the nerve
          to stand still and chuck gas-bombs
          at him.

The Reporters turn to Denham, saying "Oh, you're the hero."
"Come on spill it," etc.

     DENHAM
          No, lay off me. Miss Darrow is the
          story. If it hadn't been for her,
          we'd never have got near KONG. He
          came back to the village for her.

     3RD REPORTER
          Beauty and the Beast, huh?

     DENHAM
          That's it. Play up that angle.
          Beauty and the Beast. KONG could
          have stayed safe where we'd never
          have got him, but he couldn't stay
          away from Beauty. That's your
          story, boys.

     2ND REPORTER
          It's a story all right.

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          How about a few pictures?

     DENHAM
          Wait. I want you to take
          flashlights on the stage in front
          of the audience. We'll ring the
          curtain up now, and I'll make a
          speech. Tell 'em about KONG and
          Miss Darrow and Driscoll. Then when
          I call you, you all come on and
          take pictures.

The photographers ad lib. "Sure," "We'll do that," etc.

     DENHAM
          Come on Ann. I want you and Jack
          there when the curtain goes up.

     ANN
              (shrinking)
          Oh, no.

     DENHAM
          It's all right. We've knocked some
          of the fight out of him since you
          saw him.

He urges Ann off. Driscoll follows.

Cut to back of theatre, looking toward stage, curtain down.

House packed. Denham comes before the curtain. In almost the
tones of the circus spieler, he begins:

     DENHAM
          Ladies and gentlemen, I am here
          tonight to tell you a strange
          story. So strange a story that no
          one will believe it. But, ladies
          and gentlemen, seeing is believing,
          and we -- I and my partners -- have
          brought back the living proof of
          our adventure, an adventure in
          which twelve of our party met
          terrible deaths.

Cut to wings of theatre. Reporters and photographers looking
onto the stage.

     2ND PHOTOGRAPHER
          Holy smoke, look at that!

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          Hope he's tied up good and plenty.

     1ST REPORTER
          Sure he is. Denham's taking no
          chances.

Cut to front of theatre. Denham addressing audience.

     DENHAM
          - and now, ladies and gentlemen,
          before I tell you more, I am going
          to show you the greatest sight your
          eyes ever beheld. He was the king
          and the god of the world he knew,
          but now he comes to civilization,
          merely a captive, a show to gratify
          your curiosity. Ladies and
          gentlemen, look at KONG, the Eight
          Wonder of the World.

The curtain rises to disclose a raised platform, on which is
KONG, loaded with chains and so fastened that he can move
nothing but his head. Murmurs and exclamations from the
audience, a few rise to their feet to get a better look.

CUT TO medium shot on stage. Denham takes Ann's hand.

     DENHAM
          I want to introduce Miss Ann
          Darrow. The pluckiest girl I've
          ever known.

Audience applauds.

     DENHAM
          There the Beast, and here the
          Beauty. She has lived through an
          experience that no other woman ever
          dreamed of. And she was rescued
          from the very grasp of KONG by her
          future husband. I want you to meet
          a very brave gentleman, Mr. John
          Driscoll.

Audience applauds. Driscoll bows awkwardly.

     DENHAM
          Now, before I tell you the full
          story of our voyage. I am going to
          ask the gentlemen of the press to
          come forward, so that the audience
          may have the privilege of seeing
          them take the first photographs of
          KONG and his captors.

He looks off-stage and beckons. The press men come on.

     DENHAM
          Miss Darrow first, alone. Stand in
          front of KONG, Ann.

Ann reluctantly does so.

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          That's it - That's near enough.

     2ND PHOTOGRAPHER
          Ready. Hold it. Smile, please.

The flashlights go off. KONG roars. Ann looks round in
terror, with a startled cry.

     DENHAM
          Don't be alarmed, ladies and
          gentlemen. Those chains are made of
          chrome steel. He can't move.

Flashlights again. KONG roars and strains at chains. Ann
covers her face. Driscoll steps forward to her.

     DRISCOLL
          It's all right, Ann.

     DENHAM
          Get them together, boys. They're
          going to be married tomorrow.

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          Put your arm around her, Driscoll.

Driscoll does so. Flashlights. KONG roars, struggles. Ann
hides her face against Driscoll.

     DENHAM
          Wait. Hold on. He thinks you're
          attacking the girl.

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          Let him roar. Swell picture.
              (to flashlight men)
          Get this.

Flashlights again.

With a frightful roar, KONG breaks his chains.

Everyone stands paralyzed, as KONG beats his chest, roaring.

The Driscoll grabs Ann, and rushes for door.

Audience in panic. KONG roaring.

Driscoll and Ann through door.

They all ante, while 2nd Man deals.

     3RD MAN
          What's all the doings over there at
          the theatre?

     2ND MAN
          Sounds like a three-alarm fire.

     4TH MAN
          Aw, some movie stunt about a
          monkey.

     5TH MAN
          I hear the theatre's sold out.

     3RD MAN
          This town sure is full of hicks.

     1ST MAN
          Barnum was right.

KONG appears at window. They panic.

Another room in hotel. Ann and Driscoll rush in, he slams
door. Ann clings to him for a moment, then collapses on bed,
gasping and sobbing. He kneels beside her.

     DRISCOLL
          Hush, Ann. Hush, darling. It's all
          right. You're safe here.

KONG climbing building.

Another hotel room. A woman in negligee at telephone.

     WOMAN
          Yes, Jimmy, it's Mabel - I been

          did I ever break a date with you,
          honey...

     JIMMY
          Whatsa matter? Hey, kid, what yer
          yelling -- Mabel! Mabel! Operator,
          something's happened!

Exterior, hotel wall. KONG looks at her, sees she isn't Ann,
drops her disgustedly.

Driscoll's hotel room. Ann sitting on bed. Driscoll kneeling
beside her.

     DRISCOLL
          We'll stay here, dear. I won't
          leave you. They'll get him. It's
          all right.

     ANN
              (gasping)
          It's a like a horrible dream. It's
          like -- being back there -- on the
          island.

Driscoll puts his arms round her, murmurs soothingly.

KONG appears in window.

Driscoll starts up. Ann turns and sees, shrieks, cowers on
bed.

KONG smashes window, his hand comes in, reaching. Driscoll
picks up a chair and attacks hand.

KONG'S hand knocks him across room, where he lies senseless.

KONG'S hand drags the bed to the window, picks up Ann, takes
her out window.

Driscoll staggers to window, looks up after KONG, turns and
rushes out.

Hotel corridor. Denham running toward camera, followed by
pop
eyed bell-boys, clerks and waiter.

Door to Driscoll's room opens, and Driscoll staggers out,
almost colliding with Denham.

     DENHAM
          Jack! He's climbing up, outside
          there.

     DRISCOLL
          He got Ann. He's taking her up.

     DENHAM
          The roof! Quick!

They rush off.

          What'll we do?

     DRISCOLL
              (turning to go)
          Fire Department searchlights.
          They'll keep him in sight.

          Gee, I hope he don't come down in
          the street.

     2ND MAN
          You said it.

Police Station. Sergeant at desk with phone. Denham and
Driscoll pacing the floor. Phone rings.

     SERGEANT
              (into phone)
          Yes? Yes...No, not
          yet...Headquarters is broadcasting
          the reports.
              (he hangs up)

     THE LOUDSPEAKER
          Kong, the giant ape, is still at
          large. He has not been seen since
          midnight. The whole city is
          aroused. We are hoping for a report
          at any moment.

Driscoll sits down with a groan and puts his head in his
hands. Denham rests a hand on his shoulder.

     DENHAM
          Snap out of it, Jack. They're bound
          to find him when morning comes.

     DRISCOLL
          I can't do anything. Ann's out
          there -- somewhere --

     DENHAM
          But we're pretty sure he won't hurt
          her.

     DRISCOLL
          He may have dropped her. She may be
          lying somewhere.

     THE LOUDSPEAKER
          Attention, all stations! Kong has
          been seen again. He is on the roofs
          of the warehouses at 41st Street.
          He is going toward the East River.
          He is still carrying Ann Darrow.

Driscoll leaps up, clutching Denham.

Phone on desk rings.

     SERGEANT
              (answering it)
          Yes?...Yes, the report just come
          in...I don't know. What can we do
          without killing the girl, too?

     DENHAM
          If he puts Ann down --

     SERGEANT
              (into phone)
          It'll be daylight in an hour. Keep
          him in sight.

     THE LOUDSPEAKER
          Kong is going West. He is making
          for the Empire State Building.

     DRISCOLL
              (to Sergeant)
          If he goes up there, what can we
          do?

     SERGEANT
          We won't be able to get near him.

     THE LOUDSPEAKER
          Kong is climbing the Empire State.
          He is still carrying Ann Darrow.

     DENHAM
          That's licked us.

     DRISCOLL
          There's one thing that hasn't been
          tried.

     SERGEANT
          What?

     DRISCOLL
          Airplanes. If he should put Ann
          down -- if they could fly near
          enough to pick him off -- without
          hitting Ann --

     SERGEANT
          You're right! Planes -- as soon as
          it's daylight --
              (he turns to phone and
starts to call)

CUT TO planes taking off.

Crowd in street, gazing up.

Kong on top of Empire State. He puts Ann down and beats his
chest.

An airplane squadron, flying in formation.

The planes over New York. Pilot looks over side, gives
signal
to rest of squadron.

Entrance to Empire State, crowd around doors, police holding
them back. Denham, Driscoll, with two policemen, push their
way through crowd. They pause in door.

     DENHAM
          Here comes the planes.

     POLICEMAN
          They'll get him.

     DRISCOLL
          Can they shoot him and not hit Ann?
              (he starts inside)

     POLICEMAN
          Hold on. Don't you get on that roof
          too.

     DENHAM
          Give the pilots a chance, Jack.

They all exit into building.

Top of Empire State. Dawn. Kong turns and looks up at a
plane, roars and beats his chest.

In plane, shot over pilot's shoulder, as plane dives at

He staggers, turns slowly, and topples off roof.



EXT. NEW YORK STREET - GENERAL VIEW - NIGHT (STOCK)

Fire engines, searchlight units, police cars, motorcycles
and what not, speeding through crowded streets with
sirens blowing. This would be particularly effective in
some well recognized location such as Times Square.



EXT. 3RD ROOFS - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

Kong, carrying the girl, runs across roofs to the edge of a
city street. He leaps across the street, or alley, if the
distance is too great, and catches a window of a building on
the opposite side. He pulls himself up and continues the
chase. Crowds can be seen below.



EXT. 2ND STREET - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

Confusion in the street below this building as the crowds of

LAP DISSOLVE



EXT. 4TH ROOFS - FULL SHOT - DAWN

officer, as they rush across roof tops and stop bewildered
as they see no trace of Kong. The first streaks of dawn
are tinging the sky.



EXT. 4TH ROOFS - MED. SHOT - DAWN

     POLICE CAPTAIN
          It's no use. All night we've been
          after him -- and never got near
          enough to take a shot.

     POLICE LIEUTENANT
          It'll be daylight soon. That ought
          to help.

     POLICE CAPTAIN
          Help the ape, maybe.

     DRISCOLL
          There he goes -- making for the
          Empire State Building.

Points to --



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - GENERAL VIEW - DAWN

-- Kong with the girl seen in the distance, going across
roofs toward Empire State Building background. Probably no
men needed in this shot, as building gives size.



EXT. 4TH ROOFS - MED. SHOT - DAWN

     POLICE CAPTAIN
          If he takes the girl up there with
          him, we're fair beat.

     POLICE LIEUTENANT
          That's right. We can't shoot him
          down while he has the girl.

     DRISCOLL
          Wait a minute. There's one thing we
          haven't tried.

     POLICE CAPTAIN
          And what is that?

     DRISCOLL
          Air planes. The army planes from
          Roosevelt Field. They might find a
          way to pick him off without
          touching her.

     POLICE CAPTAIN
          You're right.
              (to Lieutenant)
          Get to a phone, Tim. Call the
          field, - burn up the wires -

As they move away, DISSOLVE OUT.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

police cars, motorcycles, fire engines, and two of three
searchlight units, keeping their lights fixed on him. Police
are keeping the crowd back. VERTICAL SHOT DOWN.



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

Kong climbs to stand on the dome, holding the girl. He beats
his chest, defying the whole civilized world.



EXT. SKY AND CITY - GENERAL VIEW - DAWN

fly in formation.



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

Kong hears the planes. He turns to look as the squadron
leader banks about the top of the building, making a
reconnaissance. Kong puts the girl down and suddenly reaches
out, snatches the plane out of the air. He crumples it and
hurls it to --



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

-- the street below. It lands just short of the crowd and
bursts into flames.



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

Kong again roars angry defiance at the world.



EXT. 2ND AIRPLANE - MED. SHOT - DAWN

The observer of a 2nd plane taps the pilot's back, indicates
here's their chance. The military pilot of the second
airplane fires machine gun as he dives.

(NOTE: A LONG SHOT of Kong in dome from angle of plane would
it it's possible, help observer get this over. Maybe ZOOM
SHOT, plane in background)



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The airplane whizzes by Kong, firing into him.



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MED. SHOT - DAWN

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MED. SHOT - DAWN

--



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

-- pick her up.



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MED. SHOT

As he stares at her with a puzzled, hurt look. The he puts
her --



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

coughs as he drums his chest, daring them to come on.



EXT. CITY AND SKY - FULL SHOT - DAWN

The remainder of the squadron dive together towards the
Empire State Building.



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

Kong as he falls to --



EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN

-- the street below. He lands beside the burning airplane.



EXT. DOME OF THE EMPIRE STATE - DAWN

Ann lying on ledge. Driscoll, Denham, couple of cops rush
in, as Kong goes over. Driscoll leaps across, gets Ann,
he is incoherent with terror for her. He kisses her
wildly, talking all the time.

     DRISCOLL
          Ann! Ann! Are you all right? Oh, my
          darling, sure you're not hurt?

     ANN
          Ad lib.

Denham and one cop lean over the parapet looking down at the
fallen Kong.

     COP
              (drawing a long breath)
          Gee, what a sight. Well, the
          aviators got him.

     DENHAM
          Oh no, 'twasn't the aviators
              (Cops looks question)
          It was Beauty killed the Beast.

Cop stares at him, very puzzled.

  FADE OUT.
